Perl 5: Dancer2 Documentation Improvements
==========================================

Description
-----------

A survey run by the Dancer Core team in 2017 showed that 37.2% of developers that responded did not like the documentation for Dancer2. While some minor
progress has been made on this front, it is not enough. A full documentation rewrite is underway, but needs a fresh set of eyes to carry this project to 
completion. In addition, an extensive set of examples (with tests) is needed to illustrate the concepts presented in the manual.


Expected outcomes
-----------------

Presently, about 75% of the rewrite has been completed. For this project:

* Complete the remaining portion of the rewritten Dancer2 manual

* Find and resolve any discrepancies and omissions from the original [Dancer2 Manual](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Dancer2/lib/Dancer2/Manual.pod)

* Make sure topics in the [Dancer2 Cookbook](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Dancer2/lib/Dancer2/Cookbook.pod) are still relevant following the documentation rewrite

* Make sure that concepts in the [Dancer2 Tutorial](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Dancer2/lib/Dancer2/Tutorial.pod) align with concepts presented in the manual

* Create a comprehensive set of examples (with tests) illustrating topics presented in the documentation. 


Required skills
---------------

Experience with Perl 5 is required. Dancer/Dancer2 experience is preferred but not necessary.

Fluency with the English language is a must.
