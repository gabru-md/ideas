Mentors Guide
=============

This is TPFs guide for people that want to mentor a project in the Perl ecosystem. It is important to
understand the responsibilities becoming a mentor brings about. Google has some excellent documentation
about GSoC in general and specifically for mentors. You should read it!

Adding ideas
------------

To add project ideas create a pull request for this repository. Just copy the
[project idea template](project_template.md) into the perl5 or perl6 directory (or create a new one if it does not fit
exactly in any of them) and fill it out. Use a separate file for each project idea. Please also add your project idea
to the *Project ideas* list above, itemized. If you have an idea but no mentor or the idea is not entirely fleshed out,
add it to the [incomplete-ideas.md](incomplete-ideas.md) file instead and try to complete it. Ideas without a mentor or otherwise not
fleshed out will have to be removed before this list is submitted to Google.

Project ideas need to meet certain criteria described
[on this Google page](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/defining-a-project-ideas-list). When you use the
template you should be good to go. If you have an idea and want to discuss it before adding anything,
[discuss it here or add a new issue](https://github.com/perl-gsoc-2019/ideas/issues/8).


Becoming a mentor
-----------------

You can also volunteer to become a mentor without having a specific idea. But please make sure you understand what it means to be
a mentor. To list yourself as available for mentoring, just add your name to [mentors-list.md](mentors-list.md).
